The Observer pattern:

This pattern allows you to implement a subscription mechanism in which the object that monitors changes (observer) automatically receives notifications of changes in the observed object. In the program, we have the IObserver interface, which defines the Update() method, which will be called in all subscribed observers when the state of the observed object is updated. The Observable class represents the observed object, which has methods for subscribing (Subscribe()), unsubscribing (Unsubscribe()) and notifying all subscribed observers of changes (Notify()). The ConcreteObserver class implements the IObserver interface and contains the logic for responding to updates, for example, displaying a message to the console.

State pattern:

This pattern allows an object to change its behavior depending on its state. In the program, we have an IState interface that defines the Handle() method, which performs actions specific to a particular state. The ConcreteStateA and ConcreteStateB classes implement the IState interface and define behavior for specific states A and B, respectively. The Context class represents an object that is in a certain state and has methods for changing the current state (ChangeState()) and calling the method for processing the current state (Request()).

Factory Method pattern:

This pattern is used to create objects without reference to specific classes, using a factory method to create objects in subclasses. In the program, we have an abstract Factory class that defines the CreateProduct() method, which must be implemented in subclasses to create specific products. The ConcreteFactory class inherits from Factory and implements the CreateProduct() method, which creates a specific ConcreteProduct product. The ConcreteProduct class inherits from the abstract Product class and represents a concrete product that can perform certain operations.

Program functionality:

The Observer pattern is used to observe changes in the state of the observed object. For example, when the state changes, observers automatically receive updates.
The State pattern is used to change the behavior of a program depending on its current state. For example, a program can react differently to input data or events depending on its state.
The Factory Method pattern is used to create objects of different classes without being bound to specific classes. For example, you can create objects of different types using the same creation method.
The startup process:

An ObserverPatternExample object is created that demonstrates the operation of the Observer pattern.
A StatePatternExample object is created that demonstrates the operation of the State pattern.
A FactoryMethodExample object is created that demonstrates the Factory Method pattern.




1.Double player and single player: A game can be a two player game or a single player game. Your application has the ability to switch between these modes.

2.Difficulty levels: The game has difficulty levels: “Easy, Normal, Hard and Hard. Each difficulty level can affect the speed of the ball or the reaction time of the players.

3.Final score: The program keeps track of points for each player and displays them on the screen. After the end of each round, the points are updated according to the results of the round.

4.Control with keys and possibly a mouse: Players can control their “rackets” with the keys or possibly the mouse depending on the settings.

5.Ball movement mechanics: The ball moves relative to the walls and rackets at an angle at a certain speed. When the ball reaches the boundaries of another player, it is rebounded.

6.Moving rackets and ball on the field: The refresh() function is responsible for moving the ball and rackets on the field according to the current state of the game.

7.Interaction with the user: The program interacts with the user through buttons and keyboard, accepting commands to control players and adjust the difficulty level.

8.Close and restart functions: The game has a button to close the game window. This feature allows users to close the game after finishing. There may also be a feature to restart the game or start a new round.

This is just a general overview of the functionality of your game, but of course there are other details that may be important to the user or developer, such as animations, sound effects, instructions, etc.
